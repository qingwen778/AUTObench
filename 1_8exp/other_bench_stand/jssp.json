The input includes the information of operations for each job, including their specific machine and processing time, as well as the operators with lowest processing time and their respective machines and processing times. Provide the solution in the following format:\n\n1. Schedule: List the order that jobs are processed on each machine.\n2. Makespan: The makespan of the schedule.\nThe input is:Job 0, machines and processing times for operations: [(7, 11), (8, 36), (5, 24), (6, 56), (2, 29), (0, 84), (4, 46), (3, 20), (1, 44)], operators with lowest processing time: [0: (7, 11), 7: (3, 20)]; Job 1, machines and processing times for operations: [(7, 19), (6, 17), (4, 46), (8, 95), (3, 9), (1, 50), (5, 61), (0, 79), (2, 18)], operators with lowest processing time: [4: (3, 9), 1: (6, 17)]; Job 2, machines and processing times for operations: [(8, 64), (5, 41), (2, 67), (7, 60), (0, 17), (4, 91), (3, 76), (1, 78), (6, 39)], operators with lowest processing time: [4: (0, 17), 8: (6, 39)]; Job 3, machines and processing times for operations: [(2, 60), (1, 7), (6, 91), (3, 19), (7, 64), (0, 76), (5, 79), (4, 28), (8, 44)], operators with lowest processing time: [1: (1, 7), 3: (3, 19)]; Job 4, machines and processing times for operations: [(0, 23), (8, 68), (3, 85), (2, 60), (1, 9), (5, 48), (6, 47), (4, 97), (7, 62)], operators with lowest processing time: [4: (1, 9), 0: (0, 23)]; Job 5, machines and processing times for operations: [(7, 31), (2, 64), (1, 31), (8, 2), (0, 90), (6, 52), (5, 66), (3, 9), (4, 2)], operators with lowest processing time: [3: (8, 2), 8: (4, 2)]; Job 6, machines and processing times for operations: [(0, 84), (1, 80), (4, 78), (3, 44), (8, 53), (7, 56), (2, 22), (5, 77), (6, 15)], operators with lowest processing time: [8: (6, 15), 6: (2, 22)]; Job 7, machines and processing times for operations: [(0, 19), (4, 88), (5, 36), (7, 6), (8, 21), (2, 56), (3, 9), (1, 69), (6, 46)], operators with lowest processing time: [3: (7, 6), 6: (3, 9)]; Job 8, machines and processing times for operations: [(2, 80), (8, 29), (6, 55), (3, 99), (5, 35), (7, 36), (0, 50), (4, 88), (1, 22)], operators with lowest processing time: [8: (1, 22), 1: (8, 29)]; Job 9, machines and processing times for operations: [(4, 41), (6, 60), (0, 49), (8, 84), (3, 19), (1, 37), (2, 98), (7, 50), (5, 2)], operators with lowest processing time: [8: (5, 2), 4: (3, 19)].
